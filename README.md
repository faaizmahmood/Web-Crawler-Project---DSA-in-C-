🚀 Web Crawler Project - DSA in C++ | 3rd Semester

🔍 Description:
Implemented a robust web crawler as part of the 3rd-semester project, showcasing proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. The project involved designing and developing a web crawler that efficiently navigates through web pages, retrieves relevant information, and organizes data structures for optimal performance.

💡 Key Features:

Data Structures: Implemented essential data structures like queues, stacks, and hash tables to manage URLs, visited pages, and extracted data efficiently.
Algorithms: Employed advanced algorithms, including breadth-first search and depth-first search, to traverse and index web pages systematically.
Multi-threading: Implemented multi-threading to enhance crawling speed and performance, ensuring timely data retrieval.
Error Handling: Developed a robust error-handling mechanism to address issues like connection timeouts and HTTP errors, ensuring the crawler's resilience.
Scalability: Designed the crawler with scalability in mind, allowing it to handle large datasets and adapt to diverse website structures.
📈 Results:
The project successfully demonstrated the application of data structures and algorithms in building an effective web crawler. Achieved a comprehensive understanding of web crawling techniques, coding practices, and the importance of optimizing performance for real-world applications.
